IndiasGoTrip Logo Placeholder

For the static HTML landing page, you need to add a logo image at:
assets/images/logo.png

Recommended size: 200x60 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
Format: PNG with transparent background

The logo should represent IndiasGoTrip brand with:
- India theme elements (maybe an outline of India or iconic monuments)
- Travel/tourism elements (plane, compass, etc.)
- Brand colors: Orange (#E7941D) and Blue (#2B7BB9)

For now, the page will display without the logo image.
You can also use text-only branding by removing the img tag from index.html.
